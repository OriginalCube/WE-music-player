# Wallpaper Engine Music Player
This is a Wallpaper Based on my previous work Bocchi the Rock! ぼっち・ざ・ろっく！(Album)! This is a customizable version of it and allows users to add their custom music and images to this wallpaper. Every entry that you save for your custom image and music will be saved locally (local storage).

## Dev notes
Currently, I see no need to update this because it works like how I intended it to be. I could update the sizing of the components because these were built without maximizing the utilities that Flex has to offer. I would probably create a newer version of this where users will have an easier time uploading their own custom music and share it across the steam workshop.

### Built with
React JS front-end  <br />
Tailwind css for design
